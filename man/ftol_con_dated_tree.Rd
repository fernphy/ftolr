\title{Fern Tree of Life (FTOL) dated consensus phylogeny}
\format{
List of class "phylo"
}
\usage{
ftol_con_dated_tree
}
\description{
Majority-rule extended consensus phylogenetic tree of ferns inferred from
seven loci by maximum-likelihood and dated using 60 fossil ferns as
constraints, including maximal sampling of available species on GenBank.
}
\details{
A \link[=backbone_tree]{backbone phylogeny} based on full plastome sequences
including
441
tips was first inferred and used as a constraint tree for the consensus tree.

Includes
5,600
tips and
5,599
internal nodes. Branch lengths are in units of time (Ma). Node labels are
bootstrap support (BS) values (\%).

For details on methods used to infer the tree, see Nitta et al. 2022.
