\description{
\code{con_fossils} was used for the consensus tree; \code{ml_fossils} was used for the
ML tree.
}
\details{
The fossils in \code{con_fossils} and \code{ml_fossils} are generally the same, but the
node each calibrates may differ between the trees because of differences in
topology. Also, in some cases, a given fossil may only be applied to the ML
or consensus tree (not both) because the topology of the tree makes that
fossil redundant with another fossil.

The node corresponding to the fossil constraint is defined as the most recent
common ancestor (MRCA, column 'mrca') of two tips columns ('tip_1' and
'tip_2') for crown affinities, or its parent node (column 'stem_mrca') for
stem affinities. The two tips are identified automatically for monophyletic
clades, or by hand for non-monophyletic clades. 'mrca' is not defined for
monotypic groups (only 'stem_mrca').

Does not include the constraint on the root of the tree.
