\title{Fern Tree of Life (FTOL) consensus phylogeny}
\format{
List of class "phylo"
}
\usage{
ftol_con_tree
}
\description{
Majority-rule extended consensus phylogenetic tree of ferns inferred from
seven loci by maximum-likelihood, including maximal sampling of available
species on GenBank.
}
\details{
A \link[=backbone_tree]{backbone phylogeny} based on full plastome sequences
including
503
tips was first inferred and used as a constraint tree for the consensus tree.

Includes
5,611
tips and
5,610
internal nodes. Branch lengths are in units of estimated genetic change per
site (not ultrametric). Node labels are bootstrap support (BS) values (\%).

For details on methods used to infer the tree, see Nitta et al. 2022.
