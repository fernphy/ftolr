# Fern Tree of Life (FTOL) dated consensus phylogeny

Majority-rule extended consensus phylogenetic tree of ferns inferred
from seven loci by maximum-likelihood and dated using 60 fossil ferns as
constraints, including maximal sampling of available species on GenBank.

## Usage

``` r
ftol_con_dated_tree
```

## Format

List of class "phylo"

## Details

A [backbone
phylogeny](https://fernphy.github.io/ftolr/reference/backbone_tree.md)
based on full plastome sequences including 503 tips was first inferred
and used as a constraint tree for the consensus tree.

Includes 5,610 tips and 5,609 internal nodes. Branch lengths are in
units of time (Ma). Node labels are bootstrap support (BS) values (%).

For details on methods used to infer the tree, see Nitta et al. 2022.
