# Fern Tree of Life (FTOL) consensus phylogeny

Majority-rule extended consensus phylogenetic tree of ferns inferred
from seven loci by maximum-likelihood, including maximal sampling of
available species on GenBank.

## Usage

``` r
ftol_con_tree
```

## Format

List of class "phylo"

## Details

A [backbone
phylogeny](https://fernphy.github.io/ftolr/reference/backbone_tree.md)
based on full plastome sequences including 503 tips was first inferred
and used as a constraint tree for the consensus tree.

Includes 5,611 tips and 5,610 internal nodes. Branch lengths are in
units of estimated genetic change per site (not ultrametric). Node
labels are bootstrap support (BS) values (%).

For details on methods used to infer the tree, see Nitta et al. 2022.
