# Fern Tree of Life (FTOL) backbone phylogeny

Majority-rule extended consensus phylogenetic tree inferred from whole
fern plastomes by maximum-likelihood, including maximal sampling of
available species on GenBank.

## Usage

``` r

```

## Format

List of class "phylo"

## Details

Includes 504 tips and 503 internal nodes. Branch lengths are in units of
