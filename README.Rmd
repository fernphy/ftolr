ftolr provides access to the Fern Tree of Life (FTOL) and related datasets.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ftolr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("joelnitta/ftolr")
```

## Example

The `ft_tree()` function loads FTOL into your R session. There are several options available to control branch lengths, presence or absence of outgroup, and sampling scheme.

```{r example}
library(ftolr)
# Load the full, ultrametric tree
ft_tree("full", "ultra")
```
